# DL based blocking for entity matching

This project aims to perform blocking for entity matching using deep learning. It includes functionalities for transforming tuples into embeddings customized for blocking. This is a self-supervised approach and does not require any labeled data. We provide provides multiple instantiations for tuple embedding  and vector pairing for performing blocking. 

# Original Code, Paper and Data

For details on the architecture of the models used, take a look at authors paper
[Deep Learning for Blocking in Entity Matching: A Design Space Exploration (VLDB '21)](http://vldb.org/pvldb/vol14/p2459-thirumuruganathan.pdf).

This work is an extension of the code available at:
https://github.com/saravanan-thirumuruganathan/DeepBlocker. We have added a new more techniques mentioned in the paper in this repository

All datasets used can be downloaded from the [datasets page](https://github.com/anhaidgroup/deepmatcher/blob/master/Datasets.md).
